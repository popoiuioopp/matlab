    3.8 (a) Evaluate the polynomial
       y = x.^3 - 5.*x.^2 + 6.*x + 0.55;
    at x = 1.37. Use 3-Digits arithmetic 
    with chopping. Evaluate the percent 
    relative error.
    (b) Repeat (a) but express y as 
       y = ((x-5).*x +6).*x+0.55;
    evaluate the error and compare with 
    part (a).
